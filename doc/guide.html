<h1>User Guide</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="assumed-knowledge">Assumed knowledge</h3>
<p>To read this guide and get started with XBLUI you should have a basic understanding of HTML, XML and CSS. </p>
<p>For advanced usage you will need to know Javascript and the DOM. </p>
<p>Examples in this guide are for illustration only, and are not
appropriate for the open web without validation. In particular, HTML
examples do not include a DOCTYPE statement, and while they use some
XHTML-compatible features - lower-case tags and " /&gt;"
tag-endings on empty elements - they are not intended to be served as XHTML. </p>
<h3 id="additional-resources">Additional Resources</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbl">XML Binding Language (XBL) 2.0 specification</a>
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbl-primer">XBL 2.0 Primer</a>
give more details on XBL which is the base for XBLUI.
Note that XBLUI doesn't provide all the features detailed in the XBL specification. 
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0 specification</a>
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-primer/">WAI-ARIA Primer</a>
introduce the concept of <i>roles</i> to add semantic value to HTML elements and improve accessibility.
The nature of ARIA roles is similar to that of XBLUI bindings in that they apply to a single element and, in some cases,
rely on interaction with roles / bindings applied to other elements. </p>
<p>ARIA roles and XBLUI bindings are also complementary since roles add semantic value but do not impact behavior
whereas bindings handle behavior only. 
In fact, many XBLUI bindings match ARIA roles and XBLUI could frequently provide scripted behavior for an ARIA enhanced web-page 
without having to customise bindings. 
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/">Web Forms 2.0 specification</a>
is a proposed extension to HTML Forms. Many of the HTML input element enhancements are available as XBLUI bindings.

<h3 id="warnings">Warnings</h3>
<h4>Work in progress</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hasn't been rigorously tested </li>
<li>Might not play nice - XBLUI hasn't been used with other
Javascript libraries and may not work well or at all</li>
</ul>
<p class="todo">TODO: What sort of libraries might
complement XBLUI? Canvas? I/O? Math
&amp; String processing?</p>
<h4>Doesn't cure CSS pain</h4>
<ul>
<li>CSS bugs aren't fixed </li>
<li>No built-in themes </li>
<li>Some XBLUI enhancements are designed to interact with your CSS </li>
</ul>
<h4>Partial implementation of XBL</h4>
<p>Besides the inherent limitations of current browsers, the major
deficiencies of the XBL implementation are, in order of importance: </p>
<ul>
<li>XBL Templates and shadow content aren't implemented. </li>
<li>Dynamic modification of HTML isn't fully supported.
Specifically, XBL bindings aren't updated if attributes (including pseudo-attributes) change
or if the position of the element in the document changes.</li>
<li>xbl processing-instructions are only registered for XHTML documents, not for HTML documents</li>
<li>loadBindingDocument() is not implemented </li>
<li>XBL documents can't be modified </li>
<li>Default action handlers aren't registered</li>
</ul>
<p>XBLUI logs warning messages for XBL elements and attributes that it doesn't implement.</p>
<p>There are also some non-standard extensions provided by XBLUI:</p>
<ul>
<li>XBL binding documents may be included with &lt;link&gt; or &lt;style&gt; elements, similar to including CSS.  </li>
<li>cross-browser (but non-standard) logging </li>
</ul>
<p>The alternate method for including XBL is essential, so some
change to your web-page will be required when native XBL
implementations become available (unless the extension is
incorporated into the standard). </p>
<h3 id="principles">Principles of use</h3>
<h4>Progressive Enhancement</h4>
<p>In general you should follow the philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Enhancement">progressive
enhancement</a> when you create your pages. </p>
<ol>
<li>Start with basic HTML markup and create pages that are semantically succinct and accessible
even when no scripting (or even styling) is available.  </li>
<li>Use CSS to enhance layout.  </li>
<li>Use XBLUI to enhance behavior.  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Enable XBLUI in your web-page by sourcing the XBLUI.js file with a
<code>script</code> element within the document's <code>head</code> element. </p>
<p>For example, to include the default version of XBLUI use the following line:</p>
<pre>&lt;script src="http://dist.meekostuff.net/XBLUI/default/XBLUI.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>You can also choose a specific branch, development snapshot or
release of XBLUI. For details see the <a href="#distribution">Distribution</a>
section of this document.</p>
<h3 id="binding-documents">Binding documents</h3>
<p>To apply enhancements or create your own custom enhancements
requires a binding document. A binding document is an XML document in
the namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/xbl. The root element is a
<code>xbl</code> element which contains all the <code>binding</code>
elements. An empty binding document will look like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;xbl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/xbl"&gt;<br />&lt;/xbl&gt;</pre>
<h4>Including  binding documents</h4>
<p>Binding documents are included into your web-page in much the same
way as CSS documents are. You may reference the URL of the document
with a <code>link</code> element, like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;link rel="bindings" type="application/xml" href="..." /&gt;</pre>
<p>Or you can include the document inline by wrapping it
inside a <code>style</code>
element like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;style type="application/xml"&gt;<br /> &lt;xbl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/xbl"&gt;<br /> ...<br /> &lt;/xbl&gt;<br />&lt;/style&gt;</pre>
<p class="note">Note: This is the HTML document equivalent
of an XBL tree in a XHTML document.</p>
<p>For both methods specifying the <code>type</code>
attribute as
"application/xml" is essential, and for the <code>link</code>
element the <code>rel</code> attribute must be
"bindings". </p>
<div class="todo">TODO: XHTML options
<ul>
<li>&lt;?xbl href="..."?&gt;</li>
<li>XBL trees in XHTML documents</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="applying-enhancements">Applying enhancements</h3>
<p>To apply enhancements to your web-page you add <code>binding</code>
elements to the binding document. Each binding specifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <code>element</code>
attribute which contains a CSS selector to identify targets for the
enhancement </li>
<li>an <code>extends</code> attribute which
contains a URL identifying the enhancement to apply </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to specify that all elements of the form <code>&lt;input
type="number"&gt;</code> should behave as in the Web Forms
2 specification, add a binding element like this:
<code></code></p>
<pre><code>&lt;binding <br /> element="input[type=text]"<br /> extends="http://dist.meekostuff.net/XBLUI/default/WF2.xml#WF2NumberInput"/&gt;</code></pre>
<p class="warn">The XBL specification also permits
attaching bindings
to elements with the <code>addBinding()</code> method and
with
the <code>binding</code> style property in CSS
documents. This
implementation doesn't support these techniques.</p>

<h3 id="distribution">Distribution</h3>
<p>The default version of XBLUI is always the most recent stable
release. Generally this is what you want to use, but if you require
more stability or would like to try features from the latest
experimental snapshot then you can switch to a specific version
simply by changing the path of the XBLUI.js file you include. </p>
<p>Firstly you need to understand how XBLUI branch, release and
snapshot versions are identified. </p>
<p>XBLUI branches are represented by two numbers, e.g. 1.0, 1.1,
1.2.
Even numbered branches are stable and odd numbered branches are
experimental. </p>
<p>Stable releases are identified by three numbers, e.g. 1.0.1,
1.2.3
where the first two numbers represent the branch and the third number
is the release number for that branch. Releases are always taken from
stable branches and are located in the release tree of the XBLUI
project.  </p>
<p>Pre-release and experimental snapshots of the code are
identified
by a code of the form A.B.xD, where A and B are numbers represent the
branch, x is a literal "x", and D is a build number.
Snapshots are found in the snapshot tree. </p>
<p>As previously stated, the default version of XBLUI is the most
recent stable release. Branches also have default releases, which are
the same as the most recent stable release from the branch. They are
identified by the the branch's two number representation, and are
located in the release tree. Branches also have default snapshots,
which are identified by a code of the form A.B.x and are located in
the snapshot tree. </p>
<p>XBLUI releases are available from
http://dist.meekostuff.net/XBLUI. The distribution tree looks like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li>XBLUI
<ul>
<li>release
<ul>
<li>1.0 <small class="info">[ 1.0 branch
default release ]</small>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
1.0.0 </li>
<li>
1.0.1 </li>
<li>
1.2 <small class="info">[ 1.2 branch default release ]</small>
</li>
<li>
1.2.0 </li>
<li>
1.2.1
<ul>
<li>snapshot
<ul>
<li>1.0.x <small class="info">[ 1.0

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
1.0.x0 </li>
<li>
1.0.x1 </li>
<li>
1.1.x <small class="info">[ 1.1 branch default snapshot ]</small>
</li>
<li>
1.1.x0 </li>
<li>
1.2.x <small class="info">[ 1.2 branch default snapshot ]</small>
</li>
<li>
1.2.x0 </li>
<li>
1.2.x1
<ul>
<li>default <small class="info">[ default release ]</small> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A XBLUI release directory has the following contents:</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<thead> <tr>
<th>
<p>Filename</p>
</th>
<td>
</td>
<th>
<p>Description</p>
</th>
</tr>
</thead> <tbody>
<tr>
<td>XBLUI.js
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>A combined image containing all script and XBL document
resources required by XBLUI.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>XBL.js
</td>
<td>

<td>The XBL engine
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UI.xml
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>XBL document with all UI enhancements
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UI.js

<td>Implementation for UI enhancements
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WF2.xml
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>XBL document which attaches WebForms2 enhancements to elements as per the specification.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Typically you would include XBLUI.js which pre-caches the other
resources. In this case the default location for XBL documents - e.g.
http://dist.meekostuff.net/XBLUI/default/UI.xml - is redirected to a
pre-cached copy of the file in the release directory. </p>
<p>This means that switching from the default XBLUI to a specific
version only requires changing the script location while all XBL
document references remain the same. </p>
